    "108:16 [Joe Rogan]: jitsu if you look at it from the outside",
    "108:19 [Joe Rogan]: you think oh a bunch of meat heads",
    "108:21 [Joe Rogan]: strangling each other sure but they're",
    "108:22 [Joe Rogan]: some of the smartest people i know or",
    "108:24 [Joe Rogan]: jiu jitsu fiends because they they get",
    "108:28 [Joe Rogan]: they first of all they get introduced to",
    "108:29 [Joe Rogan]: it because usually either they want to",
    "108:31 [Joe Rogan]: exercise or learn some self-defense but",
    "108:34 [Joe Rogan]: then they realize that it's essentially",
    "108:35 [Joe Rogan]: like a language",
    "108:37 [Joe Rogan]: with your body like you're having an",
    "108:39 [Joe Rogan]: argument with someone with some sort of",
    "108:41 [Joe Rogan]: a physical language",

    "108:57 [Joe Rogan]: jitsu is yeah i mean i kind of i mean",
    "108:59 [Elon Musk]: probably like a lot of people uh for the",
    "109:01 [Elon Musk]: the way uh early day uh the first mma",
    "109:04 [Elon Musk]: fights and joyce gracie and he was like",
    "109:07 [Elon Musk]: incredible and it was like just like",
    "109:09 [Elon Musk]: technique yeah yeah it was like you know",
    "109:12 [Elon Musk]: winning against people way bigger and",
    "109:13 [Elon Musk]: that kind of thing it's just like oh",
    "109:14 [Elon Musk]: this is cool it was what martial arts",
    "109:16 [Elon Musk]: were supposed to be when we were as we",
    "109:18 [Elon Musk]: were kids yeah when you saw bruce lee",
    "109:20 [Elon Musk]: [ __ ] up all these big giant guys like",
    "109:21 [Elon Musk]: wow martial arts allow you to beat",
    "109:24 [Elon Musk]: someone far bigger and stronger than you",
    "109:26 [Elon Musk]: right",
    "109:27 [Joe Rogan]: most of the time that's not real",
    "109:30 [Joe Rogan]: especially if they know martial arts too",
    "109:32 [Joe Rogan]: it's like oh no yes but in the ufc when",
    "109:36 [Joe Rogan]: hoist gracie",
    "109:37 [Joe Rogan]: off of his back was strangling dan",
    "109:39 [Joe Rogan]: severin with his legs he was like holy",
    "109:41 [Joe Rogan]: [ __ ] yeah this guy's being pinned by",
    "109:44 [Joe Rogan]: this big giant wrestler and he wraps his",
    "109:46 [Joe Rogan]: legs around his neck and chokes him to",
    "109:48 [Joe Rogan]: the point the guy has to surrender yeah",
    "109:50 [Joe Rogan]: amazing yeah it was amazing",
    "109:52 [Elon Musk]: i mean horse got beaten up pretty bad in",
    "109:54 [Elon Musk]: some of those he did well he definitely",

    "110:08 [Joe Rogan]: for uh",
    "110:09 [Joe Rogan]: for",
    "110:10 [Joe Rogan]: diffusing these situations with",
    "110:12 [Joe Rogan]: technique and and knowledge yeah and i",
    "110:14 [Joe Rogan]: think it's also a great way to exercise",
    "110:16 [Joe Rogan]: too because it's almost like the",
    "110:18 [Joe Rogan]: exercise is secondary to the learning of",
    "110:20 [Joe Rogan]: the thing the the exercises like you",
    "110:22 [Joe Rogan]: want like and you want to develop",
    "110:24 [Joe Rogan]: strength and conditioning just so that",
    "110:26 [Joe Rogan]: you could be better at doing the thing",
    "110:27 [Joe Rogan]: and the analogy that i use is like if",
    "110:29 [Joe Rogan]: you imagine if you had a race car",
    "110:31 [Joe Rogan]: and you could actually give the race car",
    "110:34 [Joe Rogan]: better handling and more horsepower just",
    "110:36 [Joe Rogan]: from your own focus and effort sure",

    "117:15 [Elon Musk]: okay okay",
    "117:16 [Elon Musk]: faster than that let's just say faster",
    "117:18 [Joe Rogan]: yeah that seems so crazy to me now what",
    "117:21 [Joe Rogan]: was it like when the dude threw the",
    "117:24 [Joe Rogan]: steel balls at the window and they were",
    "117:26 [Joe Rogan]: supposed to not break and it broke",
    "117:29 [Elon Musk]: well",
    "117:30 [Elon Musk]: yeah i mean i know",

    "117:36 [Elon Musk]: authentic",
    "117:38 [Elon Musk]: so i was not expecting that and i and",
    "117:39 [Elon Musk]: then i think i muttered under my breath",
    "117:44 [Joe Rogan]: you didn't get mad though",

    "117:48 [Elon Musk]: um",
    "117:49 [Elon Musk]: no i i i definitely swore uh but you",
    "117:53 [Elon Musk]: know i didn't think the mic would pick",
    "117:54 [Elon Musk]: it up but it did um",
    "117:56 [Elon Musk]: and uh",
    "117:58 [Elon Musk]: but so",
    "117:59 [Elon Musk]: like we practiced this",
    "118:01 [Elon Musk]: you know behind the scenes yeah i would",
    "118:03 [Elon Musk]: like it tesla we don't do we don't do",
    "118:06 [Elon Musk]: like tons of practice for for our demos",
    "118:08 [Elon Musk]: because we we work we're working on the",
    "118:11 [Elon Musk]: cars like we you know we're building",
    "118:13 [Elon Musk]: new technologies and and improving the",
    "118:16 [Elon Musk]: the fundamental products so we're not",
    "118:18 [Elon Musk]: spending it like doing like hundreds of",
    "118:20 [Elon Musk]: you know practice things or anything",
    "118:22 [Elon Musk]: like that we don't have time for that um",
    "118:24 [Elon Musk]: but the the",
    "118:25 [Elon Musk]: just hours before the demo um both franz",
    "118:29 [Elon Musk]: uh you know uh is a head of design and",
    "118:31 [Elon Musk]: and i were in the studio throwing steel",
    "118:34 [Elon Musk]: balls at the window and it's bouncing",
    "118:35 [Elon Musk]: right off",
    "118:36 [Elon Musk]: um and like okay this seems pretty good",
    "118:38 [Elon Musk]: seems like we got it okay",
    "118:40 [Elon Musk]: um",
    "118:41 [Elon Musk]: and then we think what happened was that",
    "118:44 [Elon Musk]: um",
    "118:45 [Elon Musk]: when we",
    "118:47 [Elon Musk]: when when franz hit the the",
    "118:49 [Elon Musk]: the door with the sledgehammer",
    "118:51 [Elon Musk]: you know sure like like this is this is",
    "118:52 [Elon Musk]: like yeah yeah yeah exoskeleton",
    "118:55 [Elon Musk]: you know high strength hardened steel",
    "118:57 [Elon Musk]: you can literally",
    "118:59 [Elon Musk]: take wind up with a sledgehammer you",
    "119:01 [Elon Musk]: know full",
    "119:02 [Elon Musk]: double-handed sledgehammer",
    "119:04 [Elon Musk]: and hit the door and there's not even a",
    "119:06 [Elon Musk]: dent it's cool",
    "119:09 [Elon Musk]: but we think that that cracked the",
    "119:10 [Elon Musk]: corner of the glass",
    "119:12 [Elon Musk]: at the bottom",
    "119:14 [Elon Musk]: and then",
    "119:16 [Elon Musk]: once you crack the corner of the glass",
    "119:17 [Elon Musk]: that you just came over",
    "119:19 [Elon Musk]: so",
    "119:20 [Elon Musk]: uh",
    "119:21 [Elon Musk]: then when you threw the bowl that that's",
    "119:23 [Elon Musk]: what cracked the glass so it didn't go",
    "119:25 [Elon Musk]: through though it didn't go through",
    "119:26 [Joe Rogan]: that's true that's true it didn't",
    "119:28 [Joe Rogan]: shatter the whole thing like a regular",
    "119:29 [Joe Rogan]: window would either which would just",
    "119:30 [Joe Rogan]: dissolve yeah right",
    "119:32 [Elon Musk]: so in hindsight the ball should have",
    "119:34 [Elon Musk]: been first sledgehammer second yeah",
    "119:36 [Elon Musk]: yeah you live you learn yeah exactly",
    "119:39 [Joe Rogan]: listen man uh we've taken up a lot of",
